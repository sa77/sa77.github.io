There are many SRIDs used for different geographies around the world. To perform geospatial functions on the same data, it has to be on the same SRID. A common one is SRID 4326 (maps to WGS84). You can store SRID data in different formats: WKT (commonly used), WKB, HEX\n\nWKT (Well Known Text) is a text markup language used by Open Geo Consortium\n\n\n\nDate/Time\n\n\nDST - Daylight Savings Time - happens when a country/region decides to wind their clocks forward one hour to make most of the available sunlight.\n\n\nUTC - Universal Time Coordinated - coordinated time scale maintained universally. Also known as \"Z time\" or \"Zulu Time\". It refers to time on the zero or Greenwich meridian, which is not adjusted to reflect changes either to or from Daylight Saving Time. So, the switch to daylight saving time does not affect UTC. Prior to 1972, this time was called Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). Always use UTC to store, pass around datetime objects.\n\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/glossary/acronyms/","title":"Acronyms"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/handy-find-command-tricks-for-nix-terminal-users/":{"body":"find command is one of those commands which is available in almost every terminal shell of a linux/UNIX based operating system.\nIt is a very handy tool that just saves a lot of time if you spend a lot of time on terminal consoles.\nHere's a quick cheatsheet sort of list for using this amazing\nutility for finding files by file-name, file-timestamp, file-size and file-permission.\nFind by filename\n# wildcards into the wild\nfind -name \"*.txt\"\nfind -type f -name \"*.txt\"\nfind -name \"2018*5*11_*\"\nfind -name \"2018.*5.*11_*\"\n# regular expressions VS wildcards\nfind -name '*.c' -o -name '*.h'\nfind -name '*.[c|h]'\n# case insensitive lookup\nfind -iname '*.Txt'\n# exclude filenames lookup\nfind ./ -not -name '*.c'\nfind ./ ! -name '*.c'\nFind by file timestamp\n# find all files that are 'accesed' 2 days ago\nfind -atime 2\n# find all files that are 'accesed' between 2-10 days ago\nfind -atime +2 -atime -10\n# find all files that are 'accesed' in last 1 hour\nfind ./ -amin 60\n# find all files that are 'modified' 2 days ago\nfind ./ -mtime 2\n# find all files that are 'modified' between 2-10 days ago\nfind ./ -mtime +2 -mtime -10\n# find all files that are 'modified' in last 1 hour\nfind ./ -mmin 60\nFind by file size\n# find all files with size more than 3MB\nfind ./ -size +3M\n# find all files with size between 3MB - 10MB\nfind ./ -size +3M -size -10M\nFind by file permission\n# find files recursively in $CWD having file permission: 0700\nfind ./ -type f -perm 0700\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/handy-find-command-tricks-for-nix-terminal-users/","title":"Handy find command tricks for CLI users"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/mongodb-basics-for-relational-db-devs/":{"body":"If you primarily work with postgreSQL (or any relational database systems) and have heard a lot of buzz regarding NoSQL databases and want to get started in one of those, here's a breif intro to get started on 'mongoDB' with one-one comparision with postgreSQL.
